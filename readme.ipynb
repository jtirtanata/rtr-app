    "I would like to make a recommendation system for dresses that are in rent the runway through analysis of comments.\n",

    "1. [Gathering data](scraping/scraping-rtr.ipynb)\n",
    "2. [Clustering](model/clustering.ipynb)\n",

    "## Tools\n",
    "1. [Bust size mapping](tools/bust_size_mapping.ipynb)\n",
    "    - mapping conventional bra sizes (e.g. 34B) to under bust to upper bust measurements.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "- Select which topics are dress related vs people related.\n",
    "- Cluster on similar dresses by the dress features, or the cluster of people they attract.\n",
    "- Rate how much a comment love the dress. If they love the dress, they will love similar dresses too.\n",
    "- If they input body data, recommend what people with the same body cluster love. "
